<h3>Target list</h3>
<p>To add new targets you can either got to the recent attacks page and save them with the button at the end of each row or add the ID at the end of the target list.
Click on the row to refresh the information.<br />
The results correspond to the latest attack made. If no attack has been found the respect is computed from the target level (base respect).<br />
If the timer starts to blink it means that the target might be out of the hospital.<br />
For the attack list, the level is guessed from the base respect so because of rounding errors it might be off &plusmn; 1.</p>
<p>The <b>Flat respect</b> is computed here without any multipliers except the fair fight \(f_\text{f}\). It yields:
$$R_\text{f} = f_\text{f} R_\text{b} = f_\text{f}\times(\ln(l)+1)/4$$
In case no recent attack has been found, we take \(f_\text{f}=1\).
