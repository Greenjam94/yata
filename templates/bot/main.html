    <h1>The YATA bot(s)</h1>
    <p>The source code of the YATA bot is currently developed and maintained by {{"Kivou"|playerURL:"2000607"|safe}} and is hosted on different servers owned by different users.</p>

    <h2>Official YATA bot</h2>
    <p>The official YATA bot is the one runned by {{"Kivou"|playerURL:"2000607"|safe}} and is on different servers at the same time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is the only one that have access to the YATA database (see below)</li>
        <li>It is the only one vouched for by {{"Kivou"|playerURL:"2000607"|safe}}</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can check if you're dealing with the official bot by checking the list of servers at the bottom of this page <b>and</b> by checking that the bot ID is <tt>623862007434706986</tt> (<a href="https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-" target="_blank">how to look at discord ID</a>).</p>
    <h2>Unofficial YATA bots</h2>
    <p>There is no control whatsoever on the different versions of the bot. Some might be better, some might be worth, some might be malicious... The only think known is that they have not access to the information put on YATA and will never have.</p>

    <h1>Discord ID</h1>
    <p>Some features requires a verified account on the <a href="https://www.torn.com/discord" target="_blank">official Torn discord server</a>.</p>
    <div id="discord-id">{% include "bot/discord-id.html" %}</div>

    <h1>Give permission to the YATA bot</h1>
    <p>Some features of the YATA bot <a href="#bot-features">[see next section]</a> require your personnal API key (stored in YATA) to pull information. It will not do it without your consent. The discord server owner will nerver have a direct access to your key and will only be able to use the bot functions. <span class="error">But</span>, server owners can play with the roles and the permissions as they which. If they have malicious intents they can use the bot without your knowledge.<br>
    So, before giving permission to the bot, make sure that <span class="warning">YOU TRUST THE OWNERS of every servers you're in and that are running the official YATA bot.</span>
    </p>
    <div id="discord-perm">{% include "bot/give-permission.html" %}</div>

    <h1 id="bot-features">Bot features asking for your key</h1>
        <h2>Feature 1. Stock sharing</h2>
        <p>If you happen to have the <tt>@wssb</tt> or <tt>@tcb</tt> role you're concerned. With your permission, the bot will be able to pull education time left and bank investement time left, respectively, and will make it visible to members of the server (supposed to be shared with <tt>@wssb</tt> and <tt>@tcb</tt> members).</p>
        <h2>More might come</h2>
        <p>But for now stock sharing is the only one.</p>
    <h2>Rule of thumb:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Look on your servers if the official YATA bot is running</li>
        <li>Look if you got any of these roles: <tt>@wssb</tt>, <tt>@tcb</tt></li>
        <ul>
            <li>If yes, you have to give permission to the bot... So read carfully what's above</li>
            <li>If no, you don't need to give the bot the permission, the other features don't require your key</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Enjoy the features!</li>
    </ol>
