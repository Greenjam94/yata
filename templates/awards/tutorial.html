<h3>Awards Tracker</h3>
<p>All awards data are updated upon refresh of the page.<br />
If you put your cursor hover the last column, you'll have an explanation.<br />
You can show the acheived awards by clicking on the top right section title.<br />
The Hall of Fame rarity score \(R\) is computed as follow:
$$R = {\sum_{a\in\mathcal{P}}r(a)} \ \Big/ \ {\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}r(a)}$$
with \(n(a)\), the number of player having the award \(a\)</li>, \(r(a)=1/n(a)\) the rarity score of award \(a\), \(\mathcal{A}\) the set of all reachable awards, \(\mathcal{P}\subset\mathcal{A}\) the set of all the awards you have.<br />
If you put your cursor hover the column rarity you'll have the contribution of each honor to this score.<br />
HoF is updated daily and considers only players who went to the Awards Tracker page.</p>
