<h3>Chain reports for AA members</h3>
<p>All reports are created automatically through API calls, no copy/paste is needed. For this to work at least one AA member needs to login (his key will be stored and used for the create of the reports).<br />
    Due to API limitations, the creation of reports is based on several crontabs which schedule the API calls over time.<br />
    Your faction will be affected to a single crontab that you will share with other factions. For one crontab a job is schedule every minute.<br />
    During one job a maximum of 200 new attacks are analysed, for a random faction of the crontab, for a random report of the faction, using a random API key of their AA members.<br />
    Live and old reports are treated on different schedulers. AA members can see their crontab details on a specific page (only available to them). <br />
    Consistency mesures insure that two API calls <tt>faction/?selections=attacks</tt> are at least 32s appart to avoid cached responses and which would lead to wrong output, even using the <tt>to</tt> and <tT>from</tt> keys.<br />
    If one AA member use this request ouside during the creation of a report, it can lead to errors in the report. In this case just delete the report and create it again.
